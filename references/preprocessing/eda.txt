Outlier detection (prevent overfitting):

-used iqr to clip outliers at left and right whiskers
-dropped samples with extremely high trans amt

Data balancing (fix accuracy metrix, ensure model is strong):

-used smote (upsampling)

-stratified into test-train split

Feature selection (reduces training time, helps some models):

-used correlation matrix to identify highly correlated features and dropped them

Feature creation?

-nobody did this, but could improve the model
